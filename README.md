Keylogger Program (For Educational Purposes Only) This repository contains a basic keylogger program written in Python. The keylogger captures and logs keystrokes typed on a keyboard and saves them to a file for analysis or record-keeping. This project is designed for educational purposes only to understand how such programs work and to promote ethical cybersecurity practices.

⚠️ Ethical Considerations Keyloggers can be misused for malicious purposes, which is illegal and unethical. This project is strictly intended for:

Learning about keylogging techniques for defensive cybersecurity measures. Developing awareness of potential threats and how to mitigate them. Use this tool responsibly and only with explicit permission. Unauthorized use of keylogging software is a violation of privacy and can lead to legal consequences.

Features Real-Time Keystroke Logging: Captures all keys pressed on the keyboard. Supports alphanumeric keys, special characters, and function keys.

Log File Storage: Saves keystroke logs to a local text file for analysis. Cross-Platform Support: Compatible with Windows, macOS, and Linux systems.

How It Works The program monitors keyboard inputs. Each key press is logged in a file (keystrokes.txt or a user-specified file). The logs can be reviewed later for analysis.
